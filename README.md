# Overview 
Winos Den has a strong standing reputation with it's customers and with this has managed to become the market leader for fine wines within it's local area. With the turbulent times over the past couple years the management have taken the decision to increase their presence online, opting to grow the business via the forms of E-commerce rather than to open a second outlet. 

With the move to push Winos Den online the business will benefit largely from the marketing outreach with promoting both the physical outlet and online store. An aggressive marketing strategy will be outlined below providing the business with the avenues needed to hit the ground running once the site goes live. 


#  User Experience (UX)

## Target Audience 

With Winos Den already being the market leader for fine wines in it's geographical area the idea to move online comes at zero loss. This move will allow the business to focus not just on it's local captive audience but to promote the business online to larger audiences and not be concerned about wasting money on potential customers who fall outside the local catchment area. 

The marketing strategy will push the boundaries on your typical audience and with the use of social media be able to push the business to audiences across the UK. The wine industry has a very large consumer base with any person over the age of 18 in the UK being a potential customer, thus targeting smaller groups can have it's pros a cons. When looking at age ranges, people over the age of 65 comprised the largest group of wine consumers, yet anyone can be a potential customer as wine is one of the most common gifts.
